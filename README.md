# cheena
> A toy programming language

## Why?
I wanted to built programming langauge just so that i can understand how computers work; how does it interprets words and gives *meaning* to them

## What does Cheena mean?
This language is dedicated to `cheena` - who made me realize the *meaning* of love.
